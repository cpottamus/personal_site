			<p>This paper is part of a research project I'm doing during my senior year at Northwestern University with Professor Mike Horn. Based on the literature research outlined in this thesis, we are conducting an experiment using a series of tangible interfaces. Our goal is to investigate how children develop cognitive models, and how they apply those mental models to knowledge domains beyond the initial problem posed. We hope to gain insight into learning methods that will empower a child to better apply procedural and conditional logic to a number of knowledge domains at ages as young as 3.
