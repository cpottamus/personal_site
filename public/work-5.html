			<p>SocialFlights was my first opportunity to design a product as a project manager. During my freshman summer at <a href="http://www.devdigital.com/" target="_blank">DevDigital</a>, I pitched a user profile design to the CEO of SocialFlights, and was subsequently given responsibility of overseeing development of the profile system. I worked closely with the CEO to make a social network that supports a user in finding and contacting other users who are interested in taking similar charter flights around the nation. In doing so, I created mock-ups and specced out the final product, eventually overseeing a team of 4 developers in building the profile system. SocialFlights has since pivoted and partnered with <a href="http://www.flycfm.com/charter/our-fleet" target="_blank">Corporate Flight Management</a>.</p>
