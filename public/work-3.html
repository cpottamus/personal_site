			<p>MusicMe is a solution to a social music problem. Have you ever been to a party or gathering where the music selection was at the mercy of the masses? Not only can it cause for a scattered or unpleasing auditory experience, conflict and confusion arises all too often from those who fight over DJing. MusicMe is an app that allows a user to create a playlist, and share it with other users. With any media device, a user can then view a playlist to add songs and vote on want they want to hear. Only the host machine can play or pause the music, and only votes can determine what songs will be played next.</p>
			<p>MusicMe was built by myself and 6 other developers in 5 weeks. Following agile process, we held stand-ups twice a week, and retros after each iteration. We managed using Trello, and tested with users from Northwestern often. We developed in python and Django, integrating APIs from <a href="http://toma.hk/">Toma.hk</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.FM</a>. The project could use some front-end love, but we still think it's a good MVP of a novel concept!</p>
