			<p>Batchelor is a product from my summer at Enova Financial. During my time there, my teams and I undertook a number of projects focused on internal improvements that could reduce business costs. Enova's infrastructure lies in its back-end batch processes, which are responsible for performing all banking and credit operations, as well as a number of other business critical activities. During my internship, I PM'd an agile team of full-time software developers in order to develop Batchelor. We overhauled the interface and operability of the severely outdated batch management tool, and built out many brand new features focused on optimizing batch runs. Our product enables better volume prediction, to enable users to catch critical volumes of batch runs before they get backed up or slow down the database. Additionally, we created a number of methods that make it easier for users to diagnose errors and redistribute batches in a way that maximizes server utility.</p><br>
			<p>Batchelor was developed on a weekly release cycle in an agile environment, and built out in Rails 4.</p>
