			<p>MathShack is a product developed by me and 2 other Northwestern students in Mountain View over our sophomore summer. We worked as a team at <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/" target="_blank">Shmoop</a> and were tasked with working with the CTO to create an interactive online math education platform. Working in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS3, we designed and implemented what came to be known as Math Shack. We began by designing the front-end, and then coding dynamically generated problems, enabling significantly more reusability in the product. After building out the first version, we recruited new developers while back in school. We specced out content, oversaw product direction, and managed the new developers as they continued building out the range of topics covered by Math Shack. We also worked extensively on implementation strategies, and specced out features including in-depth performance tracking, recommended problem sets, and gamification elements. Math Shack is now a major product at Shmoop, with over 20,000 problems being solved daily.</p>
