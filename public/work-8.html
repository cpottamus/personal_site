			<p>Documenting and prototyping the Grab'n'Go was one of my first opportunities at Northwestern to work closely with a client throughout an iterative design process. Our client and primary user was a man with quadriplegia, whose limited range of motion inhibited his performance in various day-to-day tasks. Over the course of 12 weeks, my team and I worked to find an optimal solution for our client. We met weekly with our client, and created a number of mock-ups that we shaped and refined through feedback from him and physical therapists. When there was a consensus on a final design, we prototyped it with usable materials and demonstrated the product. I enjoyed the opportunity to make something that would help another, as well as the enormous learning experience that came with iterating through the design cycle and working extensively with the user.</p>
