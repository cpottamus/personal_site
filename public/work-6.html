			<p>PurplePark is an app design made to help a user find available parking in a region, and to keep their car from being ticketed. It aims to overcome the design challenges associated with providing parking feedback on a Google maps style device. The main features we designed allow a user to filter by type of parking, find their ideal spot, and have PurplePark remind them of where his or her car is. It will also remind them when they need to act to avoid ticketing. PurplePark was a design project I made for school with a team of 3 designers. It was a great opportunity to execute an iterative and user-centered design cycle. We went through three rounds of rapid prototyping, with ample user testing and competitive product research, to reach our final design. </p>
