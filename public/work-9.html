			<p>The Factory is the product of a class's worth of work in game design. After 12 weeks of studying the pyschology behind game-making and gamification, my teammates and I set about making our own product. Our challenge was to make a game as addicting as possible. We decided to focus primarily on creating a short, challenging, and fulfilling experience. The result of this work is The Factory, a simple and fun game that leverages the qualities of 2D movement, pleasing physics, and minimalist design to make for an enjoyable platformer!
