			<p>Courseseek is the passion project of a number of Northwestern students. Tasked with coming up with our own project for a software development class, we sought to fix the headache that is finding and registering for classes at Northwestern University. The resulting MVP is <a href="http://www.courseseek.co" target="_blank">courseseek.co</a>. Within a few weeks of Courseseek going live, we had over 10,000 page views, with an impressive user retention rate. The site has since received notice from Northwestern student admissions, been adopted by our student government, and received support from a number of academic advisors. As of fall 2013, we are working towards releasing an improved version of our MVP, and marketing more aggressively within the school, with the eventual goal of expanding beyond Northwestern. 
			</p>
			<p>We hope to create a product that can expose a college's course catalog, and in doing so intelligently recommend courses to students using metrics they actually care about. By demystifying the course selection and degree requirements at a university, we hope to empower students to learn from a wider range of subjects, and to find topics they're passionate about. </p>
			<p>Courseseek was built by myself and 6 other developers in 5 weeks, and is continued on by myself and 2 others. We build agile and work closely with advisors and students to stay user-focused. The MVP was built using Ruby on Rails, postgreSQL, and with Foundation as a CSS template. We're currently working on a product release that will include re-structuring the data model, integrating AngularJS, and switching to Bootstrap 3.</p>
